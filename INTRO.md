D2F认为在公司的初级阶段，少到位的把所有功作的 在区块链上是不现实的。应该先解庆去中心化应用中的流量问题和用户体统D2F的路径是先保证每个应用都是纯样的去中心化应用，福是未来的分布式社群流量入口。然后银械公司技术的成熟。深步向公储迁
D2F believes that in the initial stage of the company, it is unrealistic to finish all the work on the blockchain. We should first solve the traffic issue of decentralized apps and the matter of user experience. The approach that D2F takes is to ensure that every app is purely decentralized and is the traffic portal for the future distributed communities. Then as the company's technology matures, gradually migrate to the public blockchain.

Although social apps, represented by WeChat, make it convenient to add people, the activeness of the community is rarely more than 5% due to loose connection. The WeChat group is more like a traffic diversion tool, and it is an embryonic form of a community.
