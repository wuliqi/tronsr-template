D2F believes that in the initial stage of the company, it is unrealistic to finish all the work on the blockchain. We should first solve the traffic issue of decentralized apps and the matter of user experience. The approach that D2F takes is to ensure that every app is purely decentralized and is the traffic portal for the future distributed communities. Then as the company's technology matures, gradually migrate to the public blockchain.
